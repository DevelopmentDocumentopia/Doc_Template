A Smarty v3 compatible templating library, based on Template Lite

Originally Documentopia.com was using Smarty2 and we were able to switch
between template lite and smarty depending on our caching requirements.   

Template Lite offered a smaller memory foot print with the exact same syntax
we were already using with smarty.   When we migrated from an Internal MVC
framework to Code Igniter we were unable to use Template Lite because it lacked
the ability to use filters/plugins utilizing the array($this,"function") method.
 
To futher complicate matters when Smarty3 came out the API was changed making
Template Lite completely incompatible with Smarty3.

For all intents and purposes Template Lite appeared dead on the development 
front, but in 2011 TL2.11 was released so we diligently unpacked it and gave it
a go - but as a diff confirmed there were actually no differences between 2.10
and 2.11.  

That is where this project was born - to extend the Template Lite Library to 
support being a drop in replacement for the features of Smarty3 we use.
